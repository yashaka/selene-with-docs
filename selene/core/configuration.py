@persistent.dataclass
class Config:
    """
    A one cross-cutting-concern-like object to group all options
    that might influence Selene behavior depending on context.
    For example, `config.timeout` is used in all "waiting" logic
    of Selene commands. And `config.base_url` is used
    in `browser.open(relative_url)` command.

    As option, the driver instance is also considered. Moreover, this config
    is not just config, but fully manages the driver lifecycle.
    Actually, the "driver manager" is a part of this config.

    While surfing through all avaialable options, pay attention to terminology:
    * all options that have a `driver` word in their name
      are related to driver management, and they are connected in a specific way:)
      – read more on this under `config.with_` doc section;)
    * all options that have a `strategy` word in their name directly influence
      the driver lifecycle in context of driver management.
    * all options that are prefixed with `_` are considered "experimental"
      – their naming can be changed in the future, or even an option can be removed

    Examples:
        Here's how you can build a driver with the instance of this config:

        >>> from selene import Config
        >>> config = Config()
        >>> driver = config.driver  # new instance, built on 1st access to `driver`
        >>> assert driver.name == 'chrome'

        Or pre-configuring the firefox driver:

        >>> from selene import Config
        >>> config = Config(driver_name='firefox')
        >>> driver = config.driver
        >>> assert driver.name == 'firefox'

        Or post-configuring the firefox driver:

        >>> from selene import Config
        >>> config = Config()
        >>> config.driver_name = 'firefox'
        >>> driver = config.driver
        >>> assert driver.name == 'firefox'

        Selene has already predefined shared instance of Config,
        so you can economize on lines of code;)...

        >>> from selene.support.shared import config
        >>> config.driver_name = 'firefox'
        >>> driver = config.driver
        >>> assert driver.name == 'firefox'

        Same shared Config instance is available as browser.config:

        >>> from selene import browser
        >>> browser.config.driver_name = 'firefox'
        >>> driver = browser.config.driver
        >>> assert driver.name == 'firefox'

        There is an alternative style of customizing config.
        The `config.option_name = value` is known in programming
        as "imperative programming" style. When you are creating
        a new Config from scratch, you are actually using
        a "declarative programming" style:

        >>> from selene import Config
        >>> my_config = Config(driver_name='firefox')
        >>> driver = my_config.driver
        >>> assert driver.name == 'firefox'

        Here is an alternative declarative style of
        customizing new config by copying existing:

        >>> from selene import browser
        >>> my_config = browser.config.with_(driver_name='firefox')
        >>> driver = my_config.driver
        >>> assert driver.name == 'firefox'
        >>> # AND...
        >>> assert driver is not browser.config.driver  # ;)
        >>> assert browser.config.driver.name == 'chrome'

        As you can see Selene config is closely related to the browser.
        Moreover, the same type of "declarative config copying" happens implicitely,
        when you apply "copying" to browser:

        >>> from selene import browser
        >>> second_browser = browser.with_(driver_name='firefox')
        >>> assert second_browser.config.driver.name == 'firefox'
        >>> # AND...
        >>> assert second_browser.config.driver is not browser.config.driver  # ;)
        >>> assert browser.config.driver.name == 'chrome'

        Moreover, if you need only a driver, you can have it
        via `browser.driver` shortcut, thus, completely hiding the config:

        >>> from selene import browser
        >>> second_browser = browser.with_(driver_name='firefox')
        >>> assert second_browser.driver.name == 'firefox'
        >>> # AND...
        >>> assert second_browser.driver is not browser.driver  # ;)
        >>> assert browser.driver.name == 'chrome'

        – such shortcut exists only for the `driver` option of config,
        not for other options like `timeout` or `base_url`.
        More nuances of `browser` behavior find in its docs;).

        And here are some more examples of customizing config
        for common test automation use cases...

    By having config options that influences Selene behavior,
    like `config.timeout` and `config.base_url`,
    – together with complete "driver management",
    we definitely break SRP principle... In the name of Good:D. Kind of;).

    All this makes it far from being a simple options data class...
    – yet kept as one «class for everything» to keep things easier to use,
    especially taking into account some historical reasons of Selenes design,
    that was influenced a lot by the Selenide from Java world.
    As a result sometimes options are not consistent with each other,
    when we speak about different contexts of their usage.
    For example, this same config,
    once customized with `config.driver_options = UiAutomator2Options()`,
    will result in mobile driver built, but then all other web-related options,
    for example, a `config.base_url` will be not relevant.
    Some of them will be ignored, while some of them,
    for example js-related, like `config.set_value_by_js`,
    will break the code execution (JavaScript does not work in mobile apps).
    In an ideal world, we would have to split this config into several ones,
    starting BaseConfig and continuing with WebConfig, MobileConfig, etc.
    Yet, we have what we have. This complicates things a bit,
    especially for us, contributors of Selene,
    but makes easier for newbies in a lot of "harder" cases,
    like customizing same shared browser instance for multi-platform test runs,
    when we have one test that works for all platforms.
    Thus, we allow to do "harder" tasks easier for "less experienced" users.
    Again, such "easiness" does not mean "simplicity" for us, contributors,
    and also for advanced Selene users,
    who want to customize things in a lot of ways
    and have them easier to support on a long run.
    But for now, let's keep it as is, considered as a trade-off.

    A driver instance with lifecycle managed by this config special options
    depending on their values and customization of this attribute.

    Once driver-definition-related options are set
    (like `config.driver_options`, `config.driver_remote_url`),
    the driver will be built on first access to this attribute.
    Thus, to build the driver with Selene,
    you simply call `config.driver` for the first time,
    and usually the simplest way to access it
    – is through either `browser.config.driver` or even `browser.driver` shortcut.
    Moreover, usually you don't do this explicitly,
    but rather use `browser.open(url)` to build a driver and open a page.

    Scenarios:
        GIVEN unset, i.e. equals to default `...` or `None`,
        WHEN accessed first time (e.g. via config.driver)
        THEN it will be set to the instance built by `config.build_driver_strategy`.

        GIVEN set manually to an existing driver instance,
              like: `config.driver = Chrome()`
        THEN it will be reused as it is on any next access
        WHEN reset to `...` OR `None`
        THEN will be rebuilt by `config.build_driver_strategy`

        GIVEN set manually to an existing driver instance (not callable),
              like: `config.driver = Chrome()`
        AND at some point of time the driver is not alive
            like crashed or quit
        AND `config._reset_not_alive_driver_on_get_url` is set to `True`,
            that is default
        WHEN driver.get(url) is requested under the hood
             like at `browser.open(url)`
        THEN config.driver will be reset to `...`
        AND thus will be rebuilt by `config.build_driver_strategy`

        GIVEN set manually to a callable that returns WebDriver instance
              (currently marked with FutureWarning, so might be deprecated)
        WHEN accessed fist time
        AND any next time
        THEN will call the callable and return the result

        GIVEN unset or set manually to not callable
        AND `config.hold_driver_at_exit` is set to `False` (that is default)
