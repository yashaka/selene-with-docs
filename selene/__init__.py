Sometimes you might need some extra actions on elements,
e.g. for workaround something through js::

    from selene import command

Probably you think that will need something like::

    from selene import query

    product_text = browser.element('#to-assert-something-non-standard').get(query.text)
    price = my_int_from(product_text)
    assert price > 100

But usually it's either better to implement your custom condition::

    browser.element('#to-assert-something-non-standard').should(have_in_text_the_int_number_more_than(100))

Where the ``have_in_text_the_int_number_more_than`` is your defined custom condition.
Such condition-based alternative will be less fragile,
because python's assert does not have "implicit waiting",
like selene's should ;)


Furthermore, the good test is when you totally control your test data, and instead::


    product = browser.element('#to-remember-for-future')

    product_text_before = product.get(query.text)
    price_before = my_int_from(product_text_before)

    # ... do something

    product_text_after = product.get(query.text)
    price_after = my_int_from(product_text_after)

    assert price_after > price_before


Normally, better would be to refactor to something like::

    product = browser.element('#to-remember-for-future')

    product.should(have.text('100$'))

    # ... do something

    product.should(have.text('125$'))


You might think you need something like::

    from selene import query

    if browser.element('#i-might-say-yes-or-no').get(query.text) == 'yes':
        # do something...

Or::

    from selene import query

    if browser.all('.option').get(query.size) >= 2:
        # do something...


Maybe one day, you really find a use case:) But for above cases, probably easier would be::

    if browser.element('#i-might-say-yes-or-no').wait_until(have.text('yes'):
        # do something

    # ...

    if browser.all('.i-will-appear').wait_until(have.size_greater_than_or_equal(2)):
        # do something

Or, by using non-waiting versions, if "you are in a rush:)"::

    if browser.element('#i-might-say-yes-or-no').matching(have.text('yes'):
        # do something

    # ...

    if browser.all('.i-will-appear').matching(have.size_greater_than_or_equal(2)):
        # do something
